        Sector Bodies
        (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).
        If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, <a rel="external"
          href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/" class="govuk-link">contact the Equality Advisory and Support
          Service (EASS)</a>.</p>

      <h2 id="technical" class="govuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The National Archives is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the
        Public Sector Bodies
        (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>

      <h3 id="compliance" class="govuk-heading-m">Compliance status</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">This website is partially compliant with the <a rel="external"
          href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" class="govuk-link">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.2</a>
        AA standard,
        due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.</p>



      <h3 id="non-accessible" class="govuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>


      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h4>

      <p class="placeholder">In this subsection, list:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet placeholder">
        <li>accessibility problems</li>
        <li>which of the WCAG 2.2 AA success criteria the problem fails on</li>
        <li>when you plan to fix the problem</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="placeholder">Do not include any problems where you’re claiming disproportionate burden, or where the
        problem is outside the scope of
        the accessibility regulations (those should go in the subsections below).</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Disproportionate burden</h4>

      <p class="placeholder">In in this subsection list accessibility problems you’re claiming would be a
        disproportionate burden to fix.</p>
      <p class="placeholder">You must carry out an assessment before claiming disproportionate burden.</p>

      <p class="placeholder">Bear in mind that something which is a disproportionate burden now will not necessarily
        be a disproportionate burden forever. If the circumstances change, your ability to claim disproportionate burden
        may change too.</p>

      <p class="placeholder">Add examples. Your statement should be specific to your website.</p>

      <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h4>

      <p class="placeholder">In this subsection list accessibility problems that fall outside the scope of the
        accessibility regulations.</p>




      <p class="placeholder">PDFs and other documents – The accessibility regulations do not require us to fix PDFs or
        other documents published before 23 September 2018
        if they’re not essential to providing our services. For example, we do not plan to fix [example of non-essential
        document].</p>

      <p class="placeholder">Any new PDFs or Word documents we publish will meet accessibility standards.</p>

      <p class="placeholder">Live video – We do not plan to add captions to live video streams because live video is
        exempt from meeting the accessibility regulations.</p>




      <h2 id="improve" class="govuk-heading-l">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p class="placeholder">[Note: publishing an accessibility roadmap is optional. It’s a good idea to publish one if
        you want to be
        specific about the order you’re planning to tackle accessibility issues,
        and there’s no space to do so in the accessibility statement itself.]</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our accessibility roadmap <span class="placeholder">[add link to roadmap]</span> shows how
        and when we plan to improve accessibility on this website.</p>

      <h2 id="preparation" class="govuk-heading-l">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">This statement was prepared on <time datetime="2024-03-15">15th March 2024</time>. It was last reviewed

        testing tools by our website team. A further audit of the website was carried out to the WCAG 2.2 AA standard.
